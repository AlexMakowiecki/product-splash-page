## Details
A website with a form, only made to practice techniques for responsive layouts.
The concepts learned in this project were:
  - **viewport units** (vh/vw), to use a value that changes based on the window (website visible area) height or width.
  - **text-transform** to transform text, in this case, to make uppercase phrases. 
  - **box-sizing** to stop the padding and border from changing element size
  - use of **background** property for background images, so you can also create a background-color, in case the image doesn't load
  - a class to make the default style of all buttons, resulting in a more DRYer CSS.
  - use of **margin:auto** to make the width of the border of the paragraph the same as the paragraph text.
