# Product splash page
## Details
A website with a form, only made to practice responsive techniques.
The concepts learned in this project were:
  - viewrport units (vh/vw), to use a value that changes based on the window (website visible area) height or width.
  - text-transform to transform text, in this case to make uppercase phrases. 
  - box-sizing to stop the padding and border from changing elements size
  - use background property for background images, so you can also create a background-color, in case the image doesnt load
  - default classes for buttons, to make a more DRYer CSS.
  - use of margin:auto to make the the width of the border of the paragraph the same as the paragraph text.
